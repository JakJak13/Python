# Python
This is (basically) a walk through of my learning the Python language. 
I cannot take credit for all of these code examples, however I will take credit for all of the mistakes made in them.
As I said, I am new to coding and this is my learning process.
Any suggestions on projects to help me further my understanding of the language are always welcome.
